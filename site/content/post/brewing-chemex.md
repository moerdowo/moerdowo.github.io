I already know about deepfakes technology for a while now, starting from reddit member that did faceswap to movie and porn, but at that time it is still hard to do the deepfakes. But with the release of this [deepfakes paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8935-first-order-motion-model-for-image-animation), which enable people to create deepfakes video easily,  now I am sure about the danger that can be caused by this deep learning technology. Imagine if someone can control your body and create fake videos, if combined with AI Voice clone technology (eg : [Lyrebird from Descript](https://www.descript.com/lyrebird-ai?source=lyrebird)) then virtually it takes control of you. Here are some example of good (and potentially dangerous) deepfakes : <https://www.creativebloq.com/features/deepfake-examples>

In the end, people and especially politicians must be aware of this technology thus they can mitigate the potential danger that can be caused.
