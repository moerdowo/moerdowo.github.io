GPT-3 is OpenAI's newly released language model trained with ~175 Billion parameters, estimated to cost 355 GPU years and cost $4.6m at this time of this blog written.

Thanks to [Sushant](https://twitter.com/sushant_kumar) , I "indirectly" got to access to the model. 

In this experiment, we input a topic (sentence or word) to the model, and then GPT-3 will replied with its thought about that topic.

**Topic:** 

Singularity

**Result:**

> The difficulty with the singularity isn’t in developing it, it’s in recognizing the developments that will lead to it.

> We are all becoming gods in a simulation of being human. (It’s not the gods who are weird, it’s the humans.)

> The next big breakthrough will come from focusing on a centralisation not a decentralisation. We should aim for 1 awesome solution, not millions of half-working systems.

> The singularity is the end of evolution in our universe.

> The next 20 years are going to change everything. Period. Singularity.

> The Singularity is Near. Sunspring invented today we are living in.

> We are all becoming gods in a simulation of being human. (It’s not the gods who are weird, it’s the humans.)

> Singularity means human immortality, freedom to do whatever we want, limited only by imagination.

And my twitter now already taken over by GPT-3 😂



> You’re close to the singularity when all you can talk about is how far away it is.
