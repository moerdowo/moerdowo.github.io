Opened a collection of old photographs on google photos and found photos of dad in old sepia photographs. I forgot what year is it, these were photographs when my dad studied in Netherland. Because I was so curious about the color of these photographs, I searched a deep learning model that can be used to colorize these photographs and found a github repo called DeOldify : <https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify>

I tried it in Amazon Sagemaker Studio and surprised with the result. It was quite good even if the original pictures's color already discolored due to sun exposure.

Below are the results:
