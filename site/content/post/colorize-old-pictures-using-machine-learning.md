Opened a collection of old photographs on google photos and find photos of dad in old sepia photograph. I forgot what year is it, these was photographs when my dad studied in Netherland. Because I'm so curious about the color of these photos, I searched a deep learning model that can be used to colorize these photographs and found a github repo called DeOldify : <https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify>

I tried it in Amazon Sagemaker Studio and surprised with the result. It was so good even if the original pictures's color already discolored due to sun exposure.

Below are the results:
