Opened my old harddisk from broken laptop and found an this banner picture of Jarvis Store exploring with bitcoin in 2015 and enables merchant to accept bitcoin payment with one click and less than 3 minutes. Bank Indonesia (BI) banned the usage of bitcoin as payment in 13 Januari 2018

and this is the screenshot picture of Jarvis Store websites in 2016 with Bitcoin and Paypal logo as the alternative payment method other than bank transfer
